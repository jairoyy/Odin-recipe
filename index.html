                  <h3>MUTTON KULAMBU</h3>
                  <p>One of the most requested recipe in YUMMY TUMMY is a proper mutton kulambu. I have been getting request for that from so many viewers. Last week I decided to give it a try. I made for my sister and we had an awesome lunch.I pressure cooked mutton pieces with all the spices and a thick masala, this made the mutton so meltingly tender. If you have got a little time, let the gravy sit for a while so that the flavours will meld together and taste even more delicious. I served it with plain rice, but this taste equally delicious with aapam, idiappam, roti and paratha. </p>

                  <p>The banana leaf is the leaf of the banana plant, which may produce up to 40 leaves in a growing cycle. The leaves have a wide range of applications because they are large, flexible, waterproof and decorative. They are used for cooking, wrapping, and food-serving in a wide range of cuisines in tropical and subtropical areas. They are used for decorative and symbolic purposes in numerous Hindu and Buddhist ceremonies. In traditional homebuilding in tropical areas, roofs and fences are made with dry banana-leaf thatch.Bananas and palm leaves were historically the primary writing surfaces in many nations of South and Southeast Asia.</p>
